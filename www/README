Introduction
=============

In this directory are some scripts to display the one day history of the
load average and the used memory on a web page.
Sure, they are not state of the art but they work for my site for a long time.

If you decide to use them, follow the instructions above.

Prerequisites
=============
Follow packages are required to run these scripts:
- perl
- php
- gnuplot
- nctop (the client will be sufficent, depending on your nctop.conf)

Install
=======
1. Edit the variables 

      NCTOPCONF - the full path to you configuration
      NCTOP     - the full path to nctop
      LOGDIR    - the place where you would like to store the data

   in  index.php, collectstat.pl and plotstat.pl.

2. Copy index.php in a directory accessible by your webserver. 
   The script plotstat.pl should be copied to a directory where CGIs 
   are searched.

3. Add a line 

*/10    *       *       *       *       PATH/collectstat.pl

to your crontab. Then, collectstat.pl will be executed every 10 minutes.
From collectstat.pl nctop is run in batch mode and the data displayed by nctop
is stored to LOGDIR.

4. Add a second line to your crontab to remove old data from LOGDIR
